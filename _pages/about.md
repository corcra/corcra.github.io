Hello! I am a Principal Researcher in Microsoft Research Health Futures based in Cambridge, UK. My research focuses on machine learning for healthcare, which means I think a lot about both machine learning and healthcare.
Recently, I have been working on vision-language/multimodal models for radiology, such as the [MAIRA-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13668) and [MAIRA-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04449) models.

I joined Microsoft Research in 2019. Before that, I received a PhD in computational biology and medicine from the [Tri-Institutional PhD Program of Cornell University](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/programs/tri-institutional-phd-programs), during which time I was situated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC, and later ETH ZÃ¼rich. Before that, I studied theoretical physics at Trinity College Dublin, and mathematics (Part III) at the University of Cambridge.

Some of my [other interests](http://apeiroto.pe/) include roller derby, board games, and watching the wildlife in my garden.
